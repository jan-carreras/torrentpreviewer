- [x] Given a Magnet link, be able to list all the files there are available
- [x] Store the information from a Magnet link somewhere
- [x] Use sqlite to store torrent information
    - [x] Store magnet to torrent info
    - [x] Store torrent info
    - [x] Store images we have on a torrent
    - [x] All of those can have extra metadata like timestamps, who requested everything and shit
- [x] Given a file on a magnet link, find the mp4 files on them and extract 1 image from the start
    - [x] Using ffmpeg extract the image
    - [x] The images need to be stored on a public accessible storage (#v2)
- [x] Create an HTTP API to serve information about the torrent and its images
- [x] Check if attaching the end of a video with the moov atom fixes image extraction problems
- [x] Add comments on all the various objects in Domain
- [ ] Reduce disk/memory usage
    - [ ] We're never cleaning up boldDB and will get huge. #mvp
    - [x] In big torrents we are not liberating memory for the downloaded parts until the whole process is finished
- [ ] Implement the HTTP endpoints
    - [ ] POST /magnet
    - [ ] POST /torrent #mvp
    - [ ] GET  /torrent/:id #mvp
    - [ ] DELETE /torrent/:id
    - [ ] Redis Cache
        - [ ] This endpoint should make intensive use of Redis for caching for reading
        - [ ] Think a way to reflect all changes from sqlite to the cache with minimal performance impact
    - [ ] Simple auth
        - [ ] Is there a simplified JWT? If not, basic auth will be more than nothing
- [ ] Refine CLI
    - [ ] Use a proper CLI framework for the commands & stuff
- [ ] Improve tests
    - [ ] Improve coverage in Domain
    - [ ] Test the infrastructure regarding SQLite
    - [ ] Think about integration tests for file/inmemory storages
- [ ] Project
    - [x] Publish it to a public repository #mvp
    - [x] Rethink license
    - [ ] Add linters & checkers to ensure source code is good #mvp
    - [ ] Add usual automation stuff
- [ ] Front end.... sigh. Can someone help with that? I don't really fancy doing it...
    - [ ] Make an MVP
        - [ ] Magnet input
        - [ ] Torrent uploader #mvp
        - [ ] Static torrent view with an polling AJAX that reloads the page on new images, or alike #mvp
- [ ] Prepare for Production #mvp
    - [ ] Create a virtual credit card to pay for all this shite
    - [ ] Image storage: Check in lowendbox.com something with proper storage
        - [ ] Example https://lowendbox.com/blog/servarica-10-month-3gb-vps-with-3-tb-disk-space-in-montreal-canada/
    - [ ] Torrent downloader: Investigate for cheap CPU-Intensive hostings
    - [ ] Create a simple build pipeline and deploy system
    - [ ] Buy domain and add a "Coming Soon webpage"
    - [ ] Install Krakend as a server
